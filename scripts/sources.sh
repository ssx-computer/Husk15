# Husk dependency pins.

# Versions deliberately match UTM's patches/sources where they overlap, because those
# exact versions are known to cross-compile for arm64-apple-ios. Husk needs only the
# subset required for a headless system-mode aarch64 QEMU: no spice, no gstreamer,
# no virglrenderer, no MoltenVK, no usb, no tpm.

# QEMU: UTM's fork release. Chosen over upstream v11.1.1 because this tarball already
# carries --enable-shared-lib (QEMU built as a dylib rather than an executable), which
# upstream does not have and which Husk requires -- iOS apps cannot spawn processes,
# so QEMU must live in-process. Its TCG is stock upstream: UTM's separate
# qemu-10.0.12-utm.patch touches 28 files and not one of them is under tcg/.

# Hard requirements for system-mode QEMU.
# libiconv and gettext come from kernel.org's GNU mirror, not ftp.gnu.org:
# the GNU server rate-limits bursty traffic and has been refusing whole
# connections from CI runners (and elsewhere) outright, and a fetch_sources.sh
# run cannot succeed without both of these. mirrors.kernel.org is a full GNU
# mirror on a global CDN and answers in seconds.

# Coroutines. The iOS SDK deprecates/withholds makecontext/swapcontext, so QEMU's
# ucontext coroutine backend needs this reimplementation. UTM's fork is pinned because
# it carries the Darwin/arm64 assembly fixes.

# User-mode networking. Not needed for Phase 0 (the Debian guest boots without a NIC),
# but Android will not come up cleanly without a network, so build it now.
