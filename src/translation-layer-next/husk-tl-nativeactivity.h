 * ANativeActivity (callbacks to fill in, the data directories, the asset manager), and from then on tells it about the activity's life -- start, a window,
 * focus -- through those callbacks, while the engine runs on a thread of its own (android_main) and talks back to Java through GameActivity's methods.
 * Before all that GameActivity.onCreate hands the engine a few facts through native calls. This does the same from C, against the Java world
 * husk-tl-jni-hle.c and husk-tl-jni-ue4.c provide.
