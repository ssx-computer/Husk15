 * Vulkan for guest code, over MoltenVK.
 *
 * Android's libvulkan.so is the standard Vulkan C API and MoltenVK implements it over Metal, so nearly every
 * call goes straight through. What this layer changes is the part that is Android-specific:
 *
 *   - VK_KHR_android_surface is offered to the guest and, when it makes a surface from its ANativeWindow,
 *     that becomes a VK_EXT_metal_surface on the window's CAMetalLayer;
 *   - extensions MoltenVK lacks are dropped from the instance the guest asks for, so creation does not fail;
 *   - for tests on a Mac the window is an off-screen layer, and presented frames are saved as images.
